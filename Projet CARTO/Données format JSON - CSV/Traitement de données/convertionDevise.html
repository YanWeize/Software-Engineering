            'Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic human pathogen causing a life-threatening form of meningitis in immunocompromised individuals, especially in AIDS patients. The capsular polysaccharide is this yeast¿s main virulence factor. It allows the yeast t o cross the hemato-encephalitis barrier and subsequently disseminate in the central nervous system. Some of the antibodies, specific for the major component of the capsule, a glucuronoxylomannan (GXM) polysaccharide, are protective against infection. Howev er, knowledge of the exact nature of the repeating units of GXM associated to the various serotypes of C. neoformans and a fortiori that of the corresponding "protective" epitopes is lacking. Using synthetic oligosaccharides made "in demand", our goal is t o fill these crucial gaps. Indeed "protective" carbohydrate epitopes may be used both as prognostic tools as well as key components in the development of an efficacious GXM-derived conjugate vaccine. Besides, the GXM structure necessary and/or sufficient f or crossing the blood brain barrier might be identified. The originality of our project is the key in-house interactive partnership between genetics and chemistry. Using state-of-the-art glycochemistry, focus will be on the development of highly reactive c onvergent synthetic strategies. A set of key versatile mono- and disaccharide building blocks, optimized for target diversity and whenever possible compatible with solid phase synthesis, will be designed. Their appropriate combination will next lead to the oligosaccharide targets, selected according to hypotheses derived from screening for the biological properties of a large panel of randomly mutated strains. The Marie Curie fellow will be in charge of the synthesis and biological evaluation of the targets , including the study of their binding to a panel of anti-GXM antibodies.\n\n',

            "Twenty years after the discovery of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)as the causative agent of the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) a vaccine to prevent virus infection or mitigate disease is still not available. Accumulating data suggest that CD8-positive T cells play an important role in the control of HIV in the infected host. Therefore, several vaccine strategies based on DNA or recombinant viral or bacterial vectors have been devised to induce this type of immune response, and some of th ese vaccines are in early clinical testing. This proposal aims at demonstrating the safety and immunogenicity in humans of a novel recombinant measles virus (MV) vector for use as an AIDS vaccine. The vector is replication competent in vivo and is deriv ed from a widely used measles vaccine strain (Schwarz), which is known to induce very long lasting immunity. Therefore, this novel vector potentially offers a unique combination of safety and potency. The recombinant HIV MV vectors will express three re latively conserved HIV proteins (Gag, Pol, Nef) from HIV clade B and A strains. A good manufacturing practices (GMP) compatible production process for the recombinant MV vector will be developed and a GMP lot will be produced for two clinical studies. Th e first study will evaluate the safety profile of the MV vector, while the second study will assess in addition the immunogenicity in MV-immune volunteers. With these two clinical studies, the project will specifically address potential shedding of the r ecombinant vector into the environment and the potential negative impact of pre-existing MV immunity. It is expected that at the end of the project sufficient clinical data on the safety and immunogenicity will have been generated to decide on subsequent advanced technical and clinical development of this novel vaccine approach.\n\n",

(2) Analysis of expression patterns by GFP enhancer trap and in situ screening will provide qualitative gene expression data and cell type specific material for quantitative analysis. (3) Expression profiling and proteomics analysis of mutant and knock-down conditions will provide quantitative data and let us model regulatory pathways. (4) A virtual European centre for targeted knock-out will provide mutant phenotypes of identified candidate genes (reverse genetics). (5) All project data will be integrated in a European zebrafish database that will present an unprecedented view of gene expression in vertebrate development, and let us apply this knowledge to human health. (6) We will establish a European Working Group on Vertebrate Models to integrate and strengthen research in the field in the ERA. ZF-MODELS will: (1) promote world class research in this key priority area of comparative genomics of clinical relevance, (2) provide the tools necessary to researchers to increase the understanding of the basic mechanisms of major human diseases, (3) bring together the leading European research groups and develop an interface with clinical researchers seeking to address major diseases, (4) contribute to the competitiveness of the pharmaceutical industry in Europe by enabling the development of improved herapies.\n\n",

            "The advent of high-throughput approaches has revolutionized the way we address biological circuits and their complex interrelation during infectious processes. Deciphering the molecular mechanisms underpinning pathogen-host interaction (PHI) is now dealt with in the context of systems biology, which is critically dependent upon our ability to analyze Omics data (whole genome sequence, whole exome sequencing, RNA-seq, proteomics, etc.) derived from both the pathogen and its host. The Institut Pasteur de Tunis (IPT) has for long been working at the interface of PHI, aimed at better delineating critical aspects governing pathogenicity and disease transmission. Through this twinning project, referred to as PHINDaccess (Pathogen-Host INteraction Data access), IPT intends to empower its capacities to efficiently exploit the extraordinary potential of Omics data generated in the context of PHI studies. PHINDaccess should in fine streamline the discovery of critical regulatory interactions, thus allowing for the rational identification of putative biomarkers, drug targets and/or lead vaccine candidates. PHINDaccess main objectives are threefold: (i) endow IPT researchers with advanced knowledge and skills in Omics science, (ii) provide IPT with an efficient high-performance bioinformatics environment, and (iii) ambition to make IPT a regional flagship for excellence in innovative Omics research with increased networking and openness to the socioeconomic sector. To achieve this goal, IPT will twin with world-renowned European centers, namely the Institut Pasteur, the Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, the Center for Genomic regulation, and the Robert Koch Institute, with whom previously EC-funded collaborations have been successfully achieved.",

Exchange of visits between IPT, IP Paris and other EU laboratories working on relevant\nfield are also planned to improve networking capacities. Two pilot projects will be performed. The aim of the pilot projects is to learn how to design and implement genetic diversity and health projects in post genomics. The pilot projects will also help stimulate EU-Tunisia cooperation, and develop competencies in genomic medicine.\nGM‐NCDin‐Co targets Institut Pasteur de Tunis, an independent governmental institution, under the tutorship of the Tunisian Ministry of Health. This more than centenary institution is considered as a national and regional centre of excellence in particular in the field of infectious diseases. To answer to the new challenges of the epidemiological transition and with the increase of prevalence of NCDs,\nIPT has developed new activities related to the investigation of the genetic basis of monogenic and\nmultifactorial diseases. Reinforcing these promising activities has a great potential to benefit EU\nresearch institutions through new international cooperation activities.",

By building a strong coalition among these institutes, EIMID aims at setting the basis for a future no-wall European Institute of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases, as part of the European Research Area (ERA).  EIMID-IAPP aims at implementing the Industry-Academia cooperation through an integrated programme of exchange of young researchers between the industrial partner and the four academic institutions. The goal of the collaborative project is the development of Novel Therapeutic Approaches against Infectious Diseases, with particular emphasis to drug-based and vaccine-based therapies for bacterial infections affecting mucosal surfaces.  Four researchers will be seconded from the industrial partner to the four academic institutions and vice-versa. Each secondment will be for two years (with a six month intermission for intermediate knowledge transfer to the mother institution), and the seconded staff between two institutions will investigate complementary aspects of the same project sub-area.  Each institution will also recruit an experienced researcher for two years, to acquire new expertise and technologies necessary to the project development. A series of informal discussions, and annual general meetings, will allow constant exchange of information and efficient project steering. This activity of Industry-Academia exchange fulfils the EIMID goals of 1) harmonising European research programmes, so as to achieve a critical mass on relevant topics.  2) fostering exchange of scientists, particularly at the doctoral and post-doctoral levels.",

In recognition of this important need, twelve major European Neuroscience Institutes have formed a network, dedicated to the promoti on of the independent work of young investigators. The institutes supply laboratory space, infrastructure, a nurturing environment, and other support, which enables young investigators to build small research teams and to perform independent work. Here, th e network applies for networking funds, such that the young investigator groups can organize regular meetings, exchange students, and share expertise. From the interactions among groups we expect a major impact on the research of the individual teams, a st ronger integration of research between participating institutions, mobilization of major resources for neuroscience, and a significant structuring effect on the research field in the future European Research Area.\n\n",

The strategy of TwinnToInfect, based on science- and innovation-driven clustering, is focused on this societal challenge that lies at the centre of many age-related disorders. TwinnToInfect will allow: i. strengthening the science and technology capacity of IMM in immunity and infection research field; ii. and leverage its research excellence and value creation through innovation with a beneficial and quantifiable impact for the entire research and development community at IMM, the Lisbon region and Portugal. The successful implementation of this strategy will rely on specific actions, including: 1) cementing of existing and the creation of new scientific, innovative and technical collaborations through short-term staff exchanges and short-term on-site training activities; 2) training, mentoring and international exposure of IMM’s young researchers and students; 3) building an innovation ecosystem centred at IMM; 4) igniting the entrepreneurial spirit among IMM’s research community; 5) increasing science awareness among the general public through targeted dissemination and communication activities; and 6) developing a sustainability strategy to sustain the cemented network beyond project terminus. Through the completion of these activities, IMM, supported by Pasteur and Crick, is in the best temporal and spatial position to achieve an improved capability to compete for internationally competitive research funding and to access business stakeholders. By claiming its position in research and innovation networks IMM will effectively contribute to research excellence and value creation in health at European level.",

            "The medium-term objective is to determine, before the end of 1997, the entire genome sequence of Bacillus subtilis, which is both of industrial importance and a model organism for Gram-positive bacteria. An international agreement has been reached allowing the allocation of regions of the chromosome among the groups of the European and Japanese Bacillus subtilis genome sequencing networks. This international project currently includes 18 European and 7 Japanese laboratories, together with 2 biotechnology companies (Genencor International and Novo Nordisk) and 1 Korean laboratory.\nThe European sequencing groups have obtained support from the European Commission (this contract and contract BIO2 CT-942011). The initial objective of contract BIO2 CT-930272 was to determine the DNA sequence of about 23% (0.97 Mbp) of the Bacillus subtilis genome.\nA cloning strategy for the construction of gene banks representative of the entire Bacillus subtilis chromosome is not available. This is, at least in part, due to the generally high level of expression of Bacillus subtilis genes observed in Escherichia coli, leading to toxic effects in this commonly used cloning host. However, participating groups have employed a variety of strategies to overcome this limitation. They include: (1) cloning into a range of plasmid, lambda and YAC vectors; (2) the use of an Escherichia coli strain that lowers the copy number of ColE1-based plasmids and which correspondingly reduces the potential toxic effects of cloned genes; (3) the use of integrative plasmids and marker rescue in genome walking experiments; (4) in vitro amplification using standard, long-range (LR PCR) and inverse PCR techniques.\nMAJOR SCIENTIFIC BREAKTHROUGHS AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS:\nDuring this contract 1.16 Mbp of Bacillus subtilis DNA has been sequenced. The European sequencing network has presently deposited a total of 1.9 Mbp of new Bacillus subtilis DNA sequence at the database maintained by the Institut Pasteur. In the current EU framework, a relational database containing 3.6 Mbp of non-redundant Bacillus subtilis DNA sequences, representing 86% of the total genome, has been constructed at the Institut Pasteur. The data are available at a new World Wide Web site: http://www.pasteur.fr/Bio/SubtiList.html.\nAn industrial platform has been set up to facilitate contacts between project participants and European biotechnology companies. The following companies have agreed to this mode of cooperation: DuPont de Nemours (France, USA), Genencor (Finland, USA), F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG (Switzerland), Novo Nordisk (Denmark), Frimond (Belgium), Roussel Uclaf (France), SmithKline Beecham (United Kingdom). Moreover, a confidential document containing a list of similarities of putatively identified B. subtilis proteins with known gene products is forwarded by the coordinator, at regular intervals, to the companies mentioned above.\n",

            "The overall objective of the Cluster is to establish a framework for preclinical development of novel tuberculosis vaccine candidates. We aim to identify optimal strategies for generation of vaccine candidates by comparing innovative approaches based on identification of novel protein antigens, characterisation of non-protein antigens that elicit T cell responses in man, and construction of live attenuated strains of mycobacteria. New vaccines will be compared alone or in combination in standardised experimental challenge models to identify candidates superior to the existing BCG vaccine. In parallel, the immunological mechanisms underlying vaccine-induced protection will be characterised in man and in experimental models. This information will be used to develop immunological tests for initial clinical assessment of new vaccines. Integration of these activites, with the participation of the top academic and industrial researchers in Europe (Aventis Pasteur, SmithKline Beecham and the Statens Serum Institut), is essential for completion of the final goal of bringing one or more new vaccines to a stage suitable for clinical trials. \nBrief description \nThe workplan for the Cluster is based on five interactive component\nProjects. Project 1 will focus on establishment of a standardised protocol\nfor preclinical assessment of vaccine candidates in a series of animal challenge models. Protein antigens with known vaccine potential will be used for comparative evaluation of delivery systems based on novel adjuvants, DNA constructs, and attenuated viral vectors. Candidates that perform optimally in naive challenge models in mice and guinea pigs will be taken forward into screening in bovine and primate models. Projects 2 and 3 are directed towards discovery of new vaccine candidates which will subsequently feed into the preclinical screening programme established in Project 1. Participants in Project 2 will use powerful new tools for genetic manipulation of mycobacteria to construct a new generation of live attenuated mycobacterial vaccines. These will include recombinant BCG strains optimised for immunogenicity and safety, as well as M. tuberculosis strains lacking key virulence determinants following random transposon mutagenesis or predictions from bioinformatic and comparative genomic analysis. Project 3 will focus on novel non-protein antigens from mycobacteria that have recently been demonstrated to induce human T cell responses. A key aspect of the Cluster is that each of these strategies can be pursued simultaneously and that the different classes of candidate can be directly compared against each other and in combination. Finally, participants in Project 4 will study the mechanisms underlying the pathological manifestations of tuberculosis and the protective immune responses induced by the different vaccine candidates. This will identify immunological tests suitable for initial assessment of new vaccines in clinical trials.\n\n",

            "The study of the evolution of the brain across species provides a unique perspective on the sources of normal and pathological variability in the human brain – a major challenge for neurosciences today.\n\nI propose a project to study the evolution of the vertebrate brain with unprecedented detail. I have a strong background in neuroimaging, computational neuroanatomy and the creation of platforms for real time collaboration in neuroimaging. During the last years I have worked on the analysis of the neuroanatomical development of the human brain and the evolution of primate brain folding, as well as in the development of Web tools to allow distributed collaboration among scientists. I propose to use this expertise to build the largest, open database of magnetic resonance imaging data of vertebrate brains. I will use state of the art computational neuroanatomy methods to build precise brain reconstructions and automatically extract a series of neuroanatomical measurements of regional brain volume, surface-based shape information and brain folding. In addition, I will develop new methods to capture the variability in shape and folding patterns using graph theory and deep learning algorithms. I will test different evolutionary scenarios using phylogenetic comparative methods, to estimate ancestral phenotypes, evolutionary changes, and the emergence of multivariate relationships across brain structures.\n\nMy project will be developed in collaboration between the Group of Theoretical and Applied Neuroanatomy at Institut Pasteur, the National Natural History Museum in Paris and the Institute of Biology of the École Normal Supérieur. This collaboration will provide the ideal framework for my project, combining the availability of one of the world’s largest vertebrate brain collections, with leading expertise in computational neuroanatomy and phylogenetic comparative methods, crucial for my future career goal of becoming a leading researcher in brain evolution.",

            "PIGYVAX aims to create pig vaccine candidates against PEDV, a pathogen of swine causing significant challenges to the swine industry globally. This project will utilize yeast-based vaccine carrying nanoparticles of measles ribonucleoprotein (RNP) fused with PEDV spike protein (S1).  The multimerization of monomeric S1 antigen through RNP will increase immunogenicity due to better recognition of antigen presenting cells. As the yeast delivery system has strong auto-adjuvant properties, the vaccine does not require complementation with accessory adjuvant, which reduces the cost of vaccine production. Moreover, P. pastoris yeast, commonly present on fruits, is a certified safe microorganism for animal feeds rendering it a most practical and convenient way to deliver vaccines to large-scale farms. Therefore, we aim to use this vaccine platform to express S1 antigen of PEDV and deliver it orally to stimulate a protective immune response against PEDV in sows, which will be passively transferred to fully protect piglets from succumbing to the disease. In this project, Dr. Phanramphoei Frantz will utilize her knowledge on pathogenesis of PEDV and the yeast-RNP platform while gaining expertise on vaccine study and development from the host institute. This will initiate a successful collaboration project between Institut Pasteur and BIOTEC (Thailand) to where the experienced researcher will return after the project.",

            "Zika virus is an emerging mosquito-borne flavivirus. Although already isolated in 1947, to date there are no specific treatments nor any vaccines available against Zika virus disease, making it a truly neglected infectious disease. The recent rapid spread of the Zika virus in previously unaffected regions has provided strong epidemiological evidence that infection with this virus might be associated with neurological complications in adults and with an increase in severe congenital brain malformations of new-borns. Consequently, the World Health Organization has declared the recent outbreak of the Zika virus a public health emergency.\nThe ZIKAVAX proposal has the objective to address this urgent public health issue by promoting the rapid development of a safe, effective, and affordable preventive vaccine against Zika virus infection. To achieve this goal, ZIKAVAX will use a delivery platform technology based on a measles vaccine vector with demonstrated proof of principle in humans and a preclinical track record of rapid adaptability and effectiveness for a variety of pathogens. The manufacturing process for these measles vector-based vaccines has been developed to give high yield and purity using standard equipment. In ZIKAVAX, following antigen selection and expression, immunisation studies will be conducted with the Zika vaccine candidate in mice and in a challenge model in non-human primates that will developed by the consortium. The ultimate goal of ZIKAVAX is the demonstration of safety and immunogenicity of a recombinant measles-Zika vaccine candidate in adult volunteers in a phase Ia clinical trial.\nZIKAVAX is driven by a strongly committed and effective consortium of four leading European organisations highly experienced in vaccine research and development. Its partners include the European Vaccine Initiative, Institut Pasteur, Themis Bioscience GmbH and the Institute of Emerging Diseases and Innovative Therapies from the Commissariat à l’Energie Atomique.",

The consortium will organise a 3-year PhD training programme for fellows who will visit different EIMID centres. Interdisciplinarity and academic-industrial cooperation will be emphasized. Ten fellows will follow an individual training pathway in the areas of host-pathogen interaction and novel strategies for designing vaccines and inhibitors. Parallel training aimed at improving complementary skills will implement the fellows' future role in the global scientific world.\n\n",

            "\n\nBacillus subtilis is a model organism for Gram-positive bacteria including pathogens, e.g. Staphylococcus, Streptococcus, Corynebacterium, Clostridium and Listeria. It is also an important industrial organism. The determination of the sequence of its genome is therefore an important objective. An international agreement has been reached allowing the allocation of regions of the chromosome among the groups of the European and Japanese Bacillus subtilis genome sequencing networks, also including two biotechnology companies (Genencor International and Novo Nordisk). The European Bacillus subtilis genome sequencing project has been supported in the framework of the current Biotechnology contracts BIO2-CT93-0272 and BIO2-CT942011 which will end in December 1996. A relational database containing more than 2000 kbp of non-redundant Bacillus subtilis DNA sequence (1050 kbp has been contributed by the European network), representing about 60 % of the total genome, has been constructed at the Institut Pasteur. During the last two years the results of this European project have been presented at 13 international meetings, and have been published in several international journals, in particular in a special issue of the journal Microbiology (1995, 141: 249-350). A major difficulty encountered during the project stems from the unavailability of a simple cloning strategy for the construction of gene banks representative of the entire Bacillus subtilis chromosome. \nThis is, at least in part, due to the generally high level of expression of Bacillus subtilis genes observed in Escherichia coli, leading to toxic effects in this commonly used cloning host. However, participating groups have employed a variety of strategies to overcome this limitation, including cloning into a range of plasmid, lambda and YAC vectors, genome walking experiments and in-vitro amplification using long-range PCR and inverse PCR techniques. Bacillus subtilis is also a major source of industrial enzymes. The world market (estimated at 400 million dollars in 1993) is dominated by the two companies mentioned above (Novo Nordisk and Genencor). An industrial platform has been set up to facilitate contacts between project participants and European biotechnology companies. The following companies have agreed in principle to this mode of cooperation: Novo Nordisk (Denmark, USA), Genencor (Finland, USA) and its subsidiary Gist-brocades (The Netherlands), F. Hoffmann La Roche AG (Switzerland), Eniricerche (Italy), Puratos (Belgium). Thirteen laboratories and five companies, which have a solid experience in large-scale sequencing, agreed to participate in the present proposal. Its objective is the determination of the remaining sequence (estimated at 1800 kbp), leading to the completion of the entire Bacillus subtilis genome sequence within one year.",

            "The proposal seeks to identify the mechanisms by which newly generated neurons in the adult olfactory bulb (OB) are integrated into a functional sensory processing network. The OB is one of only two brain regions in which newly generated cells continue to replace components of existing circuitry in adult life. How these newborn neurons are integrated into the OB network, establishing functional connections with existing cells and ensuring a seamless turnover of olfactory processing machinery, is an important issue for understanding how sensory information is processed in such a dynamic system. It also has relevance to clinical attempts at stimulating functional endogenous regeneration in the adult brain. Of particular interest is the fact that many newborn OB neurons die after reaching the bulb.\n\nDo these neurons establish initial contacts with existing OB circuitry? If so, does the information received by a newborn OB cell from the existing OB network determine whether or not it survives? We will address the se questions through in vitro electrophysiological recordings of newborn neurons in the adult OB. These recordings will be undertaken both in normal mice and in mice in which electrical activity in the OB has been systematically altered.\n\nWe aim to discover whether surviving cells receive particular patterns of input that cells destined to die do not, and whether the survival of newborn OB neurons is affected if those patterns are disrupted. To this end, Matthew Grubb, a British researcher with doctoral experience in in-vivo electrophysiology and developmental neuroscience, will join the Lledo laboratory at the Institut Pasteur in Paris, a world leader in the field of adult neurogenesis and OB function.\n\nThe proposal will allow Mr Grubb to diversify his scientific expertise en route to an independent career in neuroscience research, and should generate significant data in an exciting scientific field with important potential clinical applications.\n\n",

            "African trypanosomes are flagellated parasitic protozoans that cause the devastating, lethal disease sleeping sickness, as well as causing economically damaging livestock infections across sub-Saharan Africa. Trypanosomiasis was targeted for elimination by the WHO and others in the London declaration by 2020. Trypanosomes are transmitted by the bite of an infected tsetse fly, which restricts their geographic distribution. In the salivary gland of the fly, parasites coat their surface with approximately 10 million copies of a single variant surface glycoprotein (VSG) in a single layer which is protective against the mammalian immune system and prepares trypanosomes for infectivity. This VSG is expressed in a mono-allelic fashion from a specialized telomeric expression site. VSG coat is an important virulence mechanism; without this coat, parasites are rapidly lysed by mammalian complement. This project will address a fundamental question in trypanosome biology: How do African trypanosomes express a single VSG in its coat? I will address this questions primarily using single cell RNA-seq. First, I will establish an inDrops pipeline at the Institut Pasteur in collaboration with Prof. Andrew Griffiths at ESPCI (Paris) using cultured T. brucei, which will allow me to parameterize this novel single cell RNA-seq pipeline. Then using this protocol, I will generate single cell transcriptomes from tsetse fly derived parasites, constructing a gene expression profile for development of trypanosome infectivity. inDrops is a truly disruptive technology that allows massively parallel indexing of cellular mRNA, allowing transcriptomic analysis of thousands of single cells. These finding will have broad significance in the field; firstly, they will provide the first high-resolution single-cell transcriptome of this pathogen, and they will constitute a significant advance in our understanding of gene expression and the acquisition of infectivity in African trypanosomes.",

            '"The nuclear hormone receptor RORγt marks a family of pro-inflammatory lymphoid cells, which includes adaptive IL-17-producing helper T cells (Th17), as well as subsets of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), such as lymphoid tissue inducer (LTi) cells and IL 22-producing NKp46+ cells. These cells are required for the development of lymphoid tissues, homeostasis with symbiotic microbiota and defense against pathogens. The development and activity of RORγt+ ILCs are programmed to pre-empt intestinal colonization by bacterial symbionts and in turn, symbionts regulate the activity of RORγt+ ILCs. Thus, an equilibrated crosstalk between RORγt+ ILCs, microbiota, pathogens and adaptive immunity develops that is critical for intestinal homeostasis, a loss of which leads to inflammatory immunopathology. This project aims at understanding which and how symbiotic microbes induce and regulate RORγt+ ILCs, and how these cells control microbiota during homeostasis. To that end, GF mice will be colonized with symbiotic bacteria shown to correlate with RORγt+ ILC number and activity in normal mice. The mechanisms of regulation will then be dissected in vivo in a panel of mutant or antibody treated mice as well as in in vitro experiments. This study also aims at understanding how the homeostatic crosstalk between symbionts and RORγt+ ILCs breaks down during inflammatory pathology. In mice that lack RORγt+ ILCs, the structure of the bacterial community and propensity to develop immunopathology will be determined. Conversely, it will be tested whether inflammatory immunopathology leads to a disequilibrium between microbiota and ILCs. A better understanding of the mechanisms leading to a loss of homeostasis and immunopathological reactions is necessary to the design of new and more effective preventive and therapeutic strategies against intestinal immunopathologies. The study will be carried out in the Lymphoid Tissue Development Unit at Institut Pasteur in Paris."',

            "Persisters are transiently non-growing bacteria cells that evade antibiotic treatment and immune response. Persisters have been associated with antibiotic treatment failure and the spread of antibiotic-resistance (AMR) through mobile genetic elements. Consequently, persisters contribute significantly to the morbidity and mortality of bacterial infections, and increased medical costs. Although it is known that many pathogenic bacteria are able to form persisters, the occurrence of persistence among commensal bacteria is yet unexplored. This project aims to identify and exploit commensal persisters able to antagonise and displace pathogenic persisters, offering opportunities for the development of innovative treatment options to arrest both the relapse of persistent infections and the horizontal transfer of AMR. To this effect, I will use a combination of cutting-edge omics-based tools, in vivo murine models and the well-established and relevant Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium enteric model pathogen. After identifying commensal species forming persisters (WP1), I will assess the ability of these persisters to compete with Salmonella persisters during infection (WP2) and to arrest in vivo horizontal gene transfer from Salmonella persisters to intestinal microbiota (WP3). My goal is to become a leading academic scientist in the intertwining fields of antibiotic-resistance and antibiotic-persistence, with emphasis on the involvement of persister cells in the maintenance and spread of mobile genetic elements encoding AMR. The state-of-the-art computational and experimental training at the pioneering groups of in vivo persister biology at Harvard Medical School (HMS) in USA and of genome spatial organization at the Institut Pasteur (IP) in France will be instrumental towards achieving my goal. Apart from empowering my career track, this fellowship will foster future collaborations between HMS and IP, and promote transfer of knowledge in Europe.",

            "\n\nResearch objectives and content \nTyk2 belongs to the JAK family of intracellular tyrosine kinase implicated in signaling through cytokine receptors. Tyk2 is activated by IFN-alpha and IL-12 binding to their respective receptors. Tyk2 contributes to IE7N-alpha signaling not only as an active tyrosine kinase, but also by sustaining the steady-state of IFNAR1, one of the two IFN-alpha/beta receptor components. The major goal of my research proposal is to compare the role(s) of Tyk2 in the two receptor complexes and test a model of cross-talk between them. My work will be organized as such: \n1. investigate in more depth the observed << dependence >> of IFNAR1 from Tyk2 2. verify if the level of Tyk2 has a comparable role in sustaining the level of the beta1 component of the IL-12 receptor 3. test if the level of IFNAR1 and the cellular response to IFN-alpha can be modified by co-expression within the same cell of another Tyk2-interacting receptor. Training content (objective, benefit and expected impact) \nThe investigation of molecular mechanisms of the regulation of the response to two major cytokines involved in natural and acquired immunity may provide with a paradigm for other cytokine signaling pathways and may help towards understanding the mechanisms of abnormal regulation occurring in cancer and autoimmune diseases. Joining the group of DR.S.Pellegrini will give me the possibility to acquire a stronger theoretical and technical expertise in the field of signaling, in biochemistry and immunology, considering the facilities available in her laboratory and in the Institut Pasteur. Therefore I will be able to apply this knowledge once back to my country of origin, Italy. \nLinks with industry / industrial relevance (22) \n",

The surprising observation that inactivation of the junD gene results in mice that are viable presents a unique and powerful tool for analysis of JunD function. Furthermore, our results are unlike those obtained by inactivating other AP- 1 genes or genes known to inhibit cell growth. These mice will provide exciting insights into the specific function of JunD by allowing a detailed analysis at the molecular, cellular and physiological levels. The proposed study of fibroblast and Iymphocyte function in vitro should highlight JunD-specific function in controlling cell growth and particular induced gene expression programmes. We expect to uncover specific JunD-regulated events associated with cell growth, cell death, transformation and cell cycle. Furthermore, we will gain an appreciation of overlapping and non-redundant roles for different Jun members. This understanding will serve as the basis for investigation in vivo analysis of JunD function in physiology and pathology. \nTraining content (objective, benefit and expected impact) \nThis study will allow me to expand my knowledge and expertise in cellular and molecular biology. I will be able to contribute significantly my background in leukocyte gene expression, cellular interactions with the extracellular environment, and growth and movement of transformed cells. It will give me training in several important new areas including transcription factor biochemistry, mouse genetics and physiology, isolation of primary cell cultures etc. This breadth will strengthen my ability to function as a competent and creative scientist within the European community. I will benefit tremendously from the expertise of the Yaniv lab and the superb scientific environment of the Institut Pasteur. The results obtained will be of significance to many groups interested in the specific functions of Jun proteins and the general understanding of the processing of information from external stimuli. \n",

Brechot (Hopital Necker and Institut Pasteur), under the co-sponsoring of the EEC and WHO, with the aim of collecting information on the procedures and results of PCR studies in different laboratories, and setting up a collaborative program of PCR standardization. The meetings were intended as informal exchanges of results and technical experience, and no abstracts were printed. The main data presented at these meetings and conclusions of ensuring discussion will be summarized in this report.\nb During the October 1989 workshop, it was decided that a reference panel would be established, consisting of DNA samples from uninfected and HIV-infected cell lines. The panel would be distributed to participating laboratories to serve as a standard for specificity and sensitivity. The results obtained with this panel were presented at the October 1990 and June 1992 workshops and will be discussed below.",

Moreover, duplicate testing of the same samples in different laboratories showed wide differences in sensitivity and specificity.\nTo address these problems, our Concerted Action has sponsored two programs:\na Since October 1988, a workshop on the Standardization of PCR for the Diagnosis of HIV and HTLV Infections has been organized every year in Paris by Dr. C. Brechot (Hopital Necker and Institut Pasteur), under the co-sponsoring of the EEC and WHO, with the aim of collecting information on the procedures and results of PCR studies in different laboratories, and setting up a collaborative program of PCR standardization. The meetings were intended as informal exchanges of results and technical experience, and no abstracts were printed. The main data presented at these meetings and conclusions of ensuring discussion will be summarized in this report.\nb During the October 1989 workshop, it was decided that a reference panel would be established, consisting of DNA samples from uninfected and HIV-infected cell lines. The panel would be distributed to participating laboratories to serve as a standard for specificity and sensitivity. The results obtained with this panel were presented at the October 1990 and June 1992 workshops and will be discussed below.",

            "\n\n Research objectives and content \nRecently, Paul Brey' s group at the Pasteur Institute in Paris sequenced the promoter region of Prophenoloxidase (proPO) gene isolated from the dipteran Anopheles gambiae. They found some interesting regions highly homologous to several responsive elements like ecdysteroid hormone responsive elements, GATA elements etc. At the moment, A. gambiae has the only proPO gene completely sequenced and this study will be important in further studies to render A. gambiae inefficient to harbor the malaria parasite. In this project we want to investigate the functionality of that region of the proPO gene promoter. Furthermore, we want to verify whether this putative regulatory region of the promoter can affect proPO gene expression. Our intention is to use DNaseI footprinting experiments combined with gel shift assay in two inducible systems (the larval haemolymph and a tumorous Drosophila blood cell line (mbn-2)), to investigate the functionality of the regulatory region of the proPO gene promoter. Further, we will use the transfection assay of Drosophila tumorous blood cell to verify a possible involvement of the regulatory region of the promoter in the proPO gene expression. This project will address the very important question as to whether the possible presence of some factor in the haemolymph of A. gambiae affects the expression of the proPO gene in this environmentally important insect: a known vector of human malaria. \nTraining content (objective, benefit and expected impact) \nThis experience will be of great importance for the high quality of research and in the training provided by the host Institute. Moreover, the applicant will learn many techniques of biochemistry and molecular biology which he will in order to complete his scientific training in insect immunity. \nLinks with industry / industrial relevance (22) \n",

They investigate pathogenic factors and their regulation (cell adhesion molecules, cytokines and chemokines) in the host-pathogen relationships. These laboratories cover: A-"Schistosomiasis, Malaria and Inflammation". B-"Cellular mechanisms of the inflammatory reaction in immunoallergic and respiratory pathology", C-"Molecular mechanisms of bacterial pathogenesis", D-"Bacteriology of ecosystems", E-"Ecology of parasitism", F-"Molecular and cellular interactions of pathogenic bacteria with their hosts" and G-"DNA micro array". They have also a common interest and collaborative research in mucosal immunity. The site offers the overall panel of up-to-date technologies in molecular and cell biology, immunology and genetics, in the analysis, design and manufacturing of new molecules, and in the production and development of transgenic animals. This group of laboratories has allowed the submission and success of more than 70 doctoral thesis between 1994 and 2000, for postgraduate students from 12 different countries. Its links with Lille universities (Medical School and Science University), a constant interaction with clinical departments in the hospital, a doctoral training with the Universite Libre of Brussels, the organization of seminars and conferences with researchers of international reputation, the participation of post-graduate students to scientific meetings where they can present their results, all these facilities offer to post-graduate students a high level of training and improvement of competence.\n\n',

She wants to complete her training at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, in the fields of protein and antibody engineering. The combination of both competences will have an enormous potential in health.\n\nDengue is a re-emerging disease, which is viral, vector-borne, poverty-linked and affects 100 million persons each year. No vaccine or specific treatment is available. The dengue virus has 4 serotypes, DEN1 to DEN4. Monoclonal antibody mAb4E11 is directed against the DEN1 virus. It binds to domain 3 of the viral envelope protein E, neutralizes the viruses of the 4 serotypes, and protects the mouse.\n\nThe project consist in:\n- understanding the molecular mechanisms by which mAb4E11 interacts with the dengue virus and neutralizes its 4 serotypes; and \n- using this knowledge to develop derivatives of mAb4E11 that could be used in passive immunotherapy.\n\nThe project could also lead to improved vaccines or diagnostics. Put briefly, Domain 3 (rE3) of protein E will be expressed in a recombinant form. Assays will be set up to quantify the interactions between rE3 and:\n- mAb4E11;\n- the proteinous receptors of the virus on target cells; and\n- the heparan sulfate co-receptors.\n\nKnown mutations that affect virulence, will be introduced into rE3 by mutagenesis and their effects on these interactions measured. The binding site for mAb4E11 and for the viral (co-)receptors will be identified at the surface of rE3 by mutagenesis and compared. The relations between the molecular structure of mAb4E11 and the neutralization (or enhancement) of the viral infection will be analyzed by constructing recombinant derivatives of this antibody.\n\nThe structures of rE3 and mAb4E11 will be determined in collaboration. These studies will result in the development of potent derivatives of mAb4E11, for use in passive immunotherapy against the 4 serotypes of the dengue virus.\n\n",

            "The trans-sialidase of Trypanosoma Cruzi (TcTS) has been identified as a potential target to fight the Chagas disease, which affects 16-18 million people in Latin America and lacks an effective cure. No effective inhibitor is known for TcTS. Therefore, a de tailed understanding of its mode of action and the associated energetics is of interest and could help the design of such an inhibitor. We propose to perform this study by computational means in tight collaboration with the crystallographic group in the Institute Pasteur (P. Alzari) to further exploit their data.\n\nOn the one hand, we will analyse the contribution of different residues and ligand moieties to the binding affinities. For that, it appears important to take ligand and enzyme relaxation, as well as explicit solvent molecules into account because the recently solved high- resolution crystal structures have revealed conformational switches along the reaction and flexibility of the active site. We will use a molecular dynamics-based free energy method recently developed in the Pasteur Institute group, which fulfils these requirements and has predicted mutation effects with similar accuracy as the experiment. Furthermore, we propose to analyse the binding properties of new molecules made up of moieties taken from known ligands in order to attempt to identify the combinations giving tighter binders.\n\nThis novel computational approach will, if successful, become a very valuable tool in other projects. On the other hand, we will study the chemical steps leading to the formation of a glycosyl-enzyme covalent intermediate allowing the trans-sialidase function whilst preventing the hydrolysis (sialidase function). A quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics potential will be used to understand how the enzyme forms this covalent intermediate and which proprieties of the ligand are important for this reaction. The results of this study will be useful to explore the design of a covalent inhibitor.\n\n",

            "\n\nResearch objectives and content \nPlasmodia are mosquito-borne protozoa which cause malaria. For successful transmission, the protozoa must evade the mosquito immune response. Insect endoparasites (endoparasitoids) suppress the immune system, specifically the encapsulation response, of their insect hosts by utilising viruses and virus-like particles (VLPs). Plasmodia are also known to contain VLPs, exclusively during stages of its lifecycle which occur within the mosquito vector. Morphological, cytochemical and molecular characterisation will reveal the true nature of the VLPs within Plasmodium and provide the basis for the assessment of their role in immune evasion. \nTraining content (objective, benefit and expected impact) \nDr.Brey's research group at the Pasteur Institute, which is currently researching the molecular biology and biochemistry of encapsulation within the anopheline malaria vectors, provides a unique opportunity to carry out this proposal. In addition, the extensive expertise in microbiology at the Pasteur Institute, especially in the fields of electron microscopy and virology will give me an opportunity to learn new techniques and explore novel approaches to the study of the parasite-vector relationship. Collaboration with this research group would allow me to broaden the knowledge of vector-parasite interactions acquired as part of my PhD and explore novel mechanisms to combat malaria through the application of a challenging new approach. \nLinks with industry / industrial relevance (22) \n",

            'To promote a coherent approach to the development of malaria vaccines. This requires focused interactions between vaccine industrialists and scientists in Europe and developing countries, concerned with malaria antigens and with the wider fields which underpin malaria vaccine development. To identify and exploit existing structures and resources to support malaria vaccine develop-ment and to create fora for the regular exchange of information on planned work, progress and results germane to malaria vaccines. To provide a channel for expert advice on malaria vaccine research and development to the European Commission, as well as to other national and international authorities. To develop partnerships amongst academia, the Public Sector Vaccine Institutes and the European Vaccine Enterprises and to promote interaction amongst those engaged in malaria vaccine research and development in Europe and elsewhere.\nExpected Outcome\n\nVaccines are the most cost-effective approach to control of transmissible diseases. The benefit of this CA is in its role in expediting and rationalising progress towards malaria vaccine development and production. Continual discussions with representatives from the malaria endemic countries will benefit the process of malaria vaccine development. Developing countries will benefit from the proposed action, and also from the networks (PVEN and AMVTN) which will enhance the influence of the Developing Country partners on the process of vaccine development.\n* The primary core activity of this concerted action will be a series of expert meetings addressing different aspects of malaria vaccine development. These meetings will bring together groups of the INCO-DC (and former STD3) contract holders, other experts in the fields which underpin the science base of a malaria vaccine, and representatives of vaccine manufacturers. The industries and public sector institutes invited to specific meetings include: SmithKline Beecham (Belgium), Pasteur Merieux (France), Chi-ron/ BIOCINE (Italy), Hoffman LaRoche (Switzerland), Swiss Vaccine and Serum Institute (Switzerland), Statens Seruminstitut (Denmark) and RIVM (The Netherlands). Liaison with the European Vaccine Manufactures (EVM) is ensured.\n\n* Assistance tools will be updated and made operational: The Malaria Antigen Database (with WHO/TDR, USAID and NIAID), The compendium of in vitro and smaller animal models (with COST/STD and EVM), the PVEN document (with PVEN) and the "Atlas" and guidelines for field trials (with AMVTN).',

            "\n\nThe project is a detailed study of structural and kinetic behaviour of an important class of metabolic enzymes, the nucleotide kineses, which control the phosphorylation state of nucleosides and nucleotides within both normal and virally infected cells. Kinases are key enzymes for the therapeutic intervention as there is a large variation in substrate specificity, between host enzymes and those of bacteria and viruses. A range of powerful biophysical and computational chemistry techniques will be used to study a variety of kineses. In order to acquire high resolution data at as close to atomic level as is possible using current technology, X-ray crystallography techniques will be used in both the static and dynamic mode. Static pictures of the phosphorylation states of the enzymes TMP kineses and HSV-1 TK will be obtained using conventional crystallography and dynamic \"snapshots\" along the catalytic pathway will be attempted using Laue diffraction techniques. Cycles of X-ray crystallographic structure determination of bound drugs; molecular drug design; synthesis of new drugs will be used to obtain enhanced new pharmaceuticals. \nThe kineses we shall be initially studying and for which we have X-ray diffraction quality crystals are the TMP kinase from E. Coli and the thymidine kinase from Herpes Simplex type I [TK HSV-1]; subsequent structural studies will be undertaken for the TMP kinase for B. subtilis, M. tuberculosis, H. influenzae, Y. pestis, the thymidine kinase of HSV-2, HMV-8 (Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpes virus) and the human thymidine kinase. The TMP kinase is a very important cancer therapeutic target as it is expressed at different times in the cell cycle. Arising from the major clinical danger of widespread bacterial resistance to the conventional antibiotics developed since 1944, there is a need to identify novel targets within bacteria and selectively inhibit them. \nThe thymidine kinase from Herpes Simplex virus (HSV) is the major target for current herpes treatment and the widely sold drug aciclovir is primarily used in the clinical management of HSV-1, HSV2 and shingles. Humans are the host for 8 herpes viruses causing a wide range of debilitating and fatal infections. HMV-8 (Karposi's sarcoma associated herpes virus) is widely found in AIDS patients, 25% of whom go on to suffer Kaposi's sarcoma. The expression of the HSV-l TK gene has found wide application in gene therapy especially brain tumour treatment. \nFour major goals underpin the project. \n(1) X-ray crystallographic structure solution of kineses in complex with their natural substrates \n(2) X-ray crystallography of kineses with known inhibitors. \n(3) Design of new inhibitors on the basis of the solved structures and for related kineses from other organisms by using homology modelling. (4) Kinetic studies on tertiary complexes with 'caged' natural substrates and drugs using Laue diffraction and/or cryotrapping techniques. \nThe project will bring together a multi-disciplinary group with a diverse range of expertise from both the academic and the industrial sphere across the KU, in the areas of X-ray crystallography (Dr. Marc Delarue, The Pasteur Institute, Paris, FR; Dr. Mark Sanderson, The Randall Institute, King's College London, GB); Kinetic-Laue X-ray diffraction (Dr. Dominique Bourgeois, ESRF, Grenoble, FR) computational chemistry, molecular modelling (Prof. Modesto Orozco, Dept. of Chemistry, Univ. Barcelona, ES and Dr. David Manallack, Chiroscience, Cambridge, GB) and Organic Chemistry (Dr. Pieter Herdewijn, Rega Institute, University of Leuven, BE).",

            "These last years, several vector-borne, parasitic or zoonotic diseases have (re)-emerged and spread in the European territory with major health, ecological, socio-economical and political consequences. Most of these outbreaks are linked to global and local changes resulting of climatic changes or activities of human populations. Europe must anticipate, prevent and control new emergences to avoid major societal and economical crisis (cf. SARS in Asia, West Nile in US). EDEN (Emerging Diseases in a changing European Environment) offers a unique opportunity to prepare for uncertainties about the future of the European environment and its impact on human health. EDEN's aim is to increase preparedness by developing and coordinating at European level a set of generic investigative methods, tools and skills within a common scientific framework (Landscapes, Vector and Parasite bionomics, Public Health, Animal Reservoirs). EDEN has therefore selected for study a range of diseases that are especially sensitive to environmental changes. Some of these diseases are already present in Europe (West Nile, Rodent-born, Tick-born, Leishmaniosis), others were present historically (Malaria) and so may re-emerge, whilst finally Rift Valley Fever is either on the fringes of Europe. EDEN integrates research between 42 leading institutes from 23 countries with the combined experience and skills to reach their common goals. EDEN is organised into a series of vertical Sub-Projects led and managed by an internationally recognised expert and linked by a series of Integrative Activities that include biodiversity monitoring, environmental change detection, disease modelling, remote sensing and image interpretation, information and communication. The proposed management structure, including a Scientific Board and a User Forum, takes into account both the diversity of the partners and the size of the project. Specific links with third world countries will be achieved through an Africa platform.\n\n",

            "Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide. NSCLC alone make up about 75% of all lung cancers and most hospitals currently test all NSCLC patients for EGFR mutations (pharmacogenomics) for treatment decision (personalised medicine) – i.e., patients with mutation(s) in EGFR gene should receive a EGFR-Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) drug (e.g. afitinib) treatment; while those that do not present mutations in such gene, should be treated with chemotherapy. Currently, the laboratories use PCR and Sanger sequencing technologies to perform the EGFR analysis from tumour biopsies - Fixed Paraffin Embedded (FFPE) samples. Still, some patients (e.g., 30% in UK) may never get histological confirmation because they are too sick to make a biopsy. Furthermore, the results obtained with current methods still present low quality, mainly due to poor quality/low yield of DNA extracted from FFPE samples. The FP7 LungCARD project (www.lungcard.eu) has developed and demonstrated a LungCARD system - an automatic system composed by microfluidic chip and chip analyser - that allows to capture circulating tumour cells (CTCs) from blood samples, amplify by multiplex PCR and detect EGFR mutations, including also a software for data analysis and report. Although this new blood test has proven to be faster, cost-effective and human error-free, the detection of somatic mutations in EGFR gene at frequencies lower than 20% is still a weak point. \nTherefore, the main project’s goal is to benefit from this technology, through the development, improvement, integration and validation of the LungCARD system with NGS workflow and development of a software for automatic reporting clinical results. However, LungCARD project aims to go further, by putting together a global and unique network of multidisciplinary scientists for exchange of knowledge and research training focused on non-small cell lung cancer.",

            "CIRCE aims at developing for the first time an assessment of the climate change impacts in the Mediterranean area. \n The objectives of the project are: \n - To predict and to quantify physical impacts of climate change in the Mediterranean area \n - To evaluate the consequences of climate change for the society and the economy of the populations located in the Mediterranean area \n - To develop an integrated approach to understand combined effects of climate change \n - To identify adaptation and mitigation strategies in collaboration with regional stakeholders CIRCE wants to understand and to explain how climate will change in the Mediterranean area. \n The project will investigate how global and Mediterranean climates interact, how the radiative properties of the atmosphere and the radiative fluxes vary, the interaction between cloudiness and aerosol, the modifications in the water cycle. Recent observed modifications in the climate variables and detected trends will be compared. The economic and social consequences of climate change shall be evaluated by analyzing direct impacts on migration, tourism and energy markets together with indirect impacts on the economic system. CIRCE will moreover investigate the consequences on agriculture, forests and ecosystems. human health and air quality. \n The variability of extreme events in the future scenario and their impacts will be assessed. A rigorous common framework, including a set of quantitative indicators developed specifically for the Mediterranean environment will be developed and used in collaboration with regional stakeholders. \n The results will be incorporated in a decision support system tool and disseminated to the relevant users. Possible adaptation and mitigation strategies will be identified. The integrated results discussed by the project CIRCE will be presented in the first Regional Assessment of Climate Change in the Mediterranean area.\n\n",

            "\n\nThe European Collaborative Interspecific Backcross (EUCIB) is a major collaborative European effort to provide resources for the high resolution genetic mapping of the mouse, an important model organism in the Human Genome project. A 1,000 animal backcross has been anchor mapped across the genome providing DNAs to allow users to map new markers to a resolution of 0.3cM. EUCIB is also supported by a sophisticated database. In addition, in collaboration with the Mouse Genome Center in the US, EUCIB is being used for the construction of a high resolution genetic map of 6,000 microsatellites across the mouse genome - a prelude to the STS (sequence tagged site) based YAC contiging of the mouse genome. EUCIB aims to map 3,000 of the proposed 6,000 microsatellites. This proposal requests support to help Europe to take a major proactive role in the provision of YAC clones covering a major portion of the mapped microsatellites and thus contribute in a substantial way to the construction of the mouse physical map. Two mouse YAC libraries have been constructed in Europe and are being widely and successfully used. We propose to screen both these libraries for 1,750 genetically mapped microsatellites over the next three years laying down YACs that will cover up to one-third of the mouse genome. The proposal involves four centres - the Pasteur Institute, Paris, France; Genethon, France.St. Mary's Hospital Medical School, London, UK and the Medical Research Council Human Genome Mapping Resource Centre, UK. We also request funding to help with the database support of the project and database links with complementary efforts at the US Mouse Genome Center.",

These studies include the objective of determining the optimum delivery system.\n* To investigate the ability of recombinant candidate vaccine antigens to potentiate the protection provided by attenuated cell line vaccines.\n* To fully analyze the diversity of the candidate antigens within an endemic region.\n* To extend and develop the study of the population genetic structure of Theileria annulata in Tunisia and Morocco.\n* To investigate the potential of attenuated vaccines to revert to virulence after tick transmission.\n* To assess the effect of attenuated cell line vaccination on transmission rates of the parasite by the tick vector and evaluate the effect on genotypic variation.\nExpected Outcome\n\nThe work carried out in this project will lead to a full evaluation of the potential for developing a sub-unit vaccine based on existing recombinant antigens and determine whether a search for further antigens is required. A second outcome will be the development of sensitive diagnostic ELISA tests which potentially distinguish between vaccinated and challenged animals and can be used for routine diagnosis, epidemiological studies and post vaccination analysis. The ability of current cell lines to revert to virulence will be determined and, if they are shown to retain low virulence, this will provide assurance on the safety of large scale vaccination which, coupled with the analysis of post-vaccination tick transmission rates, will allow a better understanding of the long term effects of vaccination on disease incidence. The outcomes obtained should lead to a better control, understanding and diagnosis of the disease which will provide significant benefit to countries where the disease is endemic.\nThe main key activities will be :\n* The expression of recombinant sporozoite and merozoite antigens in E. coli and their evaluation in microtitre plate based ELISAs against a panel of defined sera to determine their species specificity and sensitivity. The cloning, sequencing and recombinant expression of an immuno-dominant macroschizont specific antigen gene and evaluation of its potential as an ELISA based diagnostic.\n* The expression of the candidate vaccine antigens in different viral and bacterial expression systems to produce sufficient material for small scale vaccination trials in cattle. The immune response (humoral and cellular) will be evaluated as well as a range of clinical parameters which will be measured after challenge. Different delivery and adjuvant systems will be tested and their role in eliciting an immune response / protection evaluated.\n* Inclusion of recombinant antigens (SPAG and Tams-1) with an attenuated cell line vaccine to determine whether these antigens can reduce the initial reaction to vaccination and potentiate protective immunity.\n* The collection of a series of parasite samples from the endemic region in Tunisia and the evaluation of the level of sequence and antigenic diversity in the sporozoite and merozoite antigen genes using a combination of PCR, RFLP, recombinant expression and Western blot techniques.\n* The Tunisian cell line vaccine will be evaluated for its ability to express 'virulence' markers (merozoite production and host metalloproteinase expression) and the clinical signs produced by vaccination. The effect of tick transmission of the vaccine on the virulence of the resulting sporozoites will then be determined by animal infection.\n* The effect of cell line vaccination of cattle in the field on the rate of transmission of the parasites by ticks will be evaluated by the measurement of tick infection rates both pre and post vaccination. Additionally, the effect of vaccination on the genotypic diversity of the parasite will be evaluated by PCR based genotyping of the parasite population in ticks.",

Such advances should pave the way for the development of new strategies and the rational design of future immunoprophylactic and immunotherapeutic measures to control leishmaniosis. Leishmaniosis constitutes not only a major public health problem of socio-economic importance but is also a veterinary problem in various parts of the world and especially in Mediterranean countries. Thus, there is a need for the development of new effective tools for their control. Recent advances in the field of molecular genetics, cellular immunological tools that the European partners have recently developed for characterizing and studying parasite and host factors promoting or circumventing the development of the disease. The rational approach that will be pursued is based on the use of all these tools focusing on two Leishmania molecules, a putative nuclear growth related factor (LNP18) and a B-cell immunodominant antigen (P32) that induces also T cell responses encoded by two novel genes recently identified by partners no 2 and no 4 respectively, for the elucidation of (a) their functions in pathogenesis (b) the nature of molecular and cellular effectors/regulators on which they act as sites of Leishmania delivery or spread (c) their impact on the selective activation and differentiation of the CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell subsets to drive a protective Th1-cell response and (d) their potential use as reagents for diagnosis. The immunogenic potential of the different Leishmania molecule formulations will be studied in the murine model and the recently established by partners no 3 and no 5, canine models. Such understanding will allow the design of rational approaches to combat leishmaniosis.\nExpected Outcome\n\nFollowing completion of the project, the results obtained will be sufficiently robust for the industrial environment and will provide new strategies and tools to help the leishmaniosis control such as: Leishmania mutants and live recombinant BCG expressing Leishmania antigens, as possible vaccine candidates, host-protective parasitic synthetic peptides and recombinant molecules as well as particulate antigens, and reliable diagnostic tools.\nIn particular, we propose to:\n\n* Develop Leishmania mutants by sequential targeted gene replacement or site directed mutagenesis.\n* Determine the phenotype conferred by LNP18 and P32 mutations.\n* Evaluate the role of LNP18 and P32 in parasite infectivity.\n\nThe study will:\n\n* Investigate the host-protective capability of defined Leishmania antigens. New protective antigens and two B immunodominant molecules LNP18 and P32 will be identified, cloned, sequenced and characterized, using recombinant molecules as well as synthetic peptides modelled from their respective amino-acid sequences.\n\n* Determine ways and parameters of directing the immune system towards a Th1 type response, by examining both CD8+ and CD4+ lymphocyte responses, using vectors such as live recombinant BCG expressing Leishmania antigens e.g. LNP18 and P32, and synthetic microspheres carrying these antigens.\n* Conduct protection studies in canine experimental models.\n\nMore specifically, we will evaluate the diagnostic potential of:\n\n* recombinant LNP18 and P32 \n* synthetic peptides modelled from P32 and LNP18 amino acid sequences, as targets for ELISA. Data on P32 and on a LNP18 20-peptide make these molecules promising reagents for serodiagnosis.",

Currently dominating views explain this phenomenon with mechanisms based on the physical and/or functional inactivation of autoreactive cells. However, these views fail in the attempt to explain certain observations like curing diseases through the transfer of cells from a healthy donor or the existence of functionally active, autoreactive T cells in vivo. In addition, there exists a large body of evidence for the existence of regulatory T cells which are responsible for the maintenance of tolerance in a normal animal, but so far these cells have not been fully characterized. In the proposed project it will be tried to characterise regulatory T cells with regard to their development inside the thymus and their behaviour in maintaining tolerance to peripheral selfantigens. \nTraining content (objective, benefit and expected impact) \nThe nature of the topic includes the application of almost all different methods available in cellular immunology, including standard methods as well as specialized techniques set up by the Pasteur Institute. Therefore, this project contains not only a very good education itself, but allows also the possibility for a broad application afterwards. The work will be carried out in the frame of a doctoral thesis. \nLinks with industry / industrial relevance (22) \nIn investigating important basic mechanisms of tolerance the expected results will strongly support solutions for problems in the field of transplantation medecine and the treatment of autoimmune diseases.",

            "Mosquitoes transmit a variety of infectious diseases that cause a tremendous burden to public health. Due to climate changes and to the increase in international trade and tourism the threats posed by mosquitoes are increasingly affecting large parts of Europe, causing understandable concerns among the populations of many Member States. Control methods, mainly based on insecticide usage, are struggling to cope with the challenges posed by the biology and ecology of mosquito vectors. INFRAVEC aims at bridging the gap between the recent advances in transgenic technology and its implementation as a novel powerful approach for vector control. To this aim, a large European Infrastructure will be established, in which the coordination of efforts, expertise and facilities provided by the individual research groups and institutions will bolster and considerably expand the overall research capabilities of the research community. INFRAVEC will operate, through a number of Networking, Joint Research, Transnational and Service activities, towards the objective of considerably strengthening research capability in Europe by sharing knowledge, resources and technology. INFRAVEC will mainly focus on Anopheles gambiae, the major vector of malaria, and Aedes albopictus, a viral disease vector that is rapidly spreading through Europe. Four Infrastructure facilities will be integrated in the project: 1) the Genetically Modified mosquito laboratory of Imperial College London; 2) the Mosquito Mass-rearing facility at the Centro Agricoltura ed Ambiente (with the support of the International Atomic Energy Agency); 3) the Bioinformatics facility at EMBLEBI, UK; and 4) the Mosquito Confined Release facility at ISRIM. INFRAVEC will provide a formidable research capability to external users and facilitate the performance of five research projects aimed at utilizing basic knowledge of mosquito genetics and biology in an unprecedented effort to develop novel opportunities for mosquito control.",

            "Significant advances in clinical practice cannot be made without a thorough understanding of the disease mechanisms from laboratory benches combined with good clinical observation and knowledge of disease management from the bed side.\n\nClinician-scientists are the only professionals who can bridge these two worlds. The clinician-scientist role started decades ago within hospitals driven by the desire to understand and cure. However, a decrease in these vocations is now threatening progress and improvement of healthcare, thereby impacting on economic competiveness worldwide. \n\nIDIBAPS, the leading biomedical research institute of Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (Spain) as pioneer in fostering clinician scientists, proposes a 60-month innovative fellowship programme called BITRECS, Biomedicine international training research programme for excellent clinician-scientists, based on excellence only. Through 2 international peer-reviewed calls, it invites 10 fellows to implement a 36-month bottom-up research project through an outgoing phase (12-18 months at any worldwide institution outside Spain) and a return phase (18-24 months at IDIBAPS), helping to make a lasting impact within the European Research Area and put the European Union ahead of the game in this crucial area of human health. \n\nBITRECS is an international, intersectorial and interdisciplinary programme. This transnational mobility scheme will boost the fellows’ professional growth through: 1) continuous career support (scientific supervision, career mentoring and support for exploiting/disseminating the results); 2) participation in scientific and non-scientific training/networking activities linked to both sectors (academic and non-academic); and, 3) sharing experiences with peers from different disciplines.\n\nIDIBAPS, with its HRS4R strategy aligned to the European Charter and Code and a strong background in other human resources programmes guarantees a successful implementation.",

            "Tuberculosis (TB) accounts amongst the most deadly infectious diseases worldwide. Despite the availability of a vaccine and effective drugs, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the etiologic agent of TB, still defies the humanity. An alarming increase in drug resistance and emergence of outbreaks has made it urgent the need for increased surveillance and control. With its structured global geographical distribution, it becomes increasingly clear that this pathogen could have established an advantageous association with its host. Such region-specific host-pathogen equilibrium argues for a TB control at a regional level. The overall objective of the present proposal consists in establishing a network connecting leading institutions in the field from the three North African countries (Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia) and Europe. The aim is to upgrade the research and surveillance capacity potential of these Europe’s most neighboring Mediterranean partner countries (MPC) through know-how sharing, two-way experience exchange, training, joint research activities, and equipment upgrading. By reinforcing existing human and technological resources in the targeted MPCs, the planned activities will contribute to better address the host and pathogen key factors governing TB transmission/expansion dynamics, emergence of drug resistance, and host susceptibility. This will endow MPCs with higher capacity to better unveil the molecular mechanisms leading to the prevailing epidemiological situation in the specific regional context. Since TB is a health threat common to both sides of the Mediterranean Sea, which is amplified through consistent population migration flows, the planned cooperative initiative could also positively impact on TB control in Europe. Ultimately, dissemination of the project’s results will foster the MPCs’ institutional visibility and scientific competitiveness, allowing them to be more integrated for participation to future European framework program calls.",

Virtual tick museum will be created linking up available tick collections and used to design taxonomic keys and predictive maps for ticks infesting ruminants in the target areas. Available serological tests will be adapted to a rapid dipstick format and, together with southern blots, evaluated for collection of improved data in epidemiological studies. Four seminars will be organised; on hemparasitegenome analysis, molecular studies, chemical tick control and integrated Control strategies.

            "New outbreaks caused by bluetongue viruses (BTVs) have emerged in European livestock every year since 1998. These events that have been linked to climate change, resulted in massive losses due to fatalities, reduced productivity, reproductive failures, restricted animal movements/trade, and surveillance/vaccination costs. PALE-Blu brings together European institutes with expertise in BTV research and diagnosis, with partners in endemic regions (Africa, the Middle East and Turkey) that act as a ‘source’ for BTV strains that emerge in Europe.\nFull-genome sequence-analyses will increase the accuracy of BTV-strain distribution maps, to identify pathways and mechanisms for spread into and within Europe, as well as appropriate prevention strategies. PALE-Blu will analyse the genetic connectivity of Culicoides vector populations in different regions, as well as the movements of individual BTV lineages and genes. Together with reverse genetics technologies and infection/replication studies in new Culicoides cell lines, or adults from different Culicoides species, this will elucidate the genetic basis for geographic localisation/movement of BTV strains and serotypes.  We will analyse differences in saliva proteins from Culicoides species, their ability to modify the BTV surface proteins (proteases) and effects on efficiency of transmission (in both directions) between vertebrae hosts and insect-vectors. These studies will provide a better understanding of incursion risks for different BTV strains, supporting effective control strategies. \nPALE-BLU will explore more effective and cross-serotype subunit-vaccines that are DIVA assay compatible and generate a stronger immune response from a single innoculation. We will also explore the potential for use of antiviral agents to induce immediate protection post vaccination.  More effective diagnostic systems to better detect mixed infections will also be developed by multiplexing existing or novel diagnostic assay systems.",

            "Aquaculture is an important food source for the world’s growing population. The increasing demand and productivity of aquaculture leads to global trade in breeding stock, genetic material and aquaculture products for human consumption, but also exacerbates the globalization of pathogens.SAFE-Aqua, an international inter- and multidisciplinary consortium, aims to provide scientific solutions to solve disease-related issues in aquaculture using shrimp as a model through research and innovation staff exchange and sharing of knowledge and ideas from research to market. SAFE-Aqua will explore the benefits of developed feed additives on keeping a healthy gut microbial balance, enhancing immune-capacity, and maintaining nutritional integrity of shrimp as a product. To assess these beneficial effects, SAFE-Aqua will synergize the cutting-edge technology platforms, multidisciplinary and complementary expertise, as well as infrastructure from networks of the partnership among the leading research institutes in France, UK and Thailand and a synthetic biology company in Spain. \nThe outcomes of SAFE-Aqua will undoubtedly help improve competitiveness of EU aquaculture industry whose growth has been relatively constant since year 2000 compared to aquaculture production worldwide. Moreover, we strongly believe that SAFE-Aqua will promote international and inter-sector collaboration through research and innovation staff exchanges and sharing of knowledge and ideas from research to market. The use of cutting-edge innovative technologies will allow to researchers to develop new skill sets helping them to develop their carreers in the best way. In addition administrative staff implicated in the project management will also greatly benefit from the knowledge exchange and build further collaborations.",

Leishmaniasis is a neglected infectious disease and a major public health and veterinary problem that afflicts both developing countries and Europe. The current technological and epidemiological advances underpin the necessity to develop training programmes aiming at developing new tools and strategies to control of leishmaniasis. An excellent group of academic and non-academic institutions in Europe and abroad will host 15 PhD students who will receive training in this programme. The expertise and training that will be offered ranges from parasitology to molecular science, genetics, epidemiology and strategic interventions. The 15 research projects designed encompass drug discovery, drug resistance, diagnostics and vaccine development, population genetics, vector control and integrated control programmes. The designated project supervisors have proven track records of success in research and in training. The incorporation of trainee mobility into the network, together with the commitment, strong affiliations and technology transfer between the participants provide a highly synergistic framework for success. The EUROLEISH-NET coordinators have proven experience in laboratory, field, administrative and financial management, supported by a meticulously planned series of meetings and diligent monitoring of the progression of each researcher. We anticipate an extremely productive training and research output from EUROLEISH-NET. We expect to train the next generation of leading research scientists in this field, endowed with skills that are broadly and internationally transposable.",

            "The proposed project aims to identify novel biomarkers and provide new insight into the mechanisms of spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) during the early stages of acute infection. Indeed hepatitis C is a major public health problem with high incidence in regions such as Egypt and other Mediterranean Partner Countries (MPCs). Our current application follows from an FP5 project entitled “Promoting Healthy Societies: research in support of regional infectious disease surveillance,” which permitted development of a cohort of patients with acute symptomatic HCV. Herein, we propose to build on this program for biochemical, immunologic and gene polymorphism assessment of patients with an enriched Consortium of European, Egyptian and Tunisian academic institutions and one European SME. Our multi-national, inter-disciplinary Consortium is in a strong position to establish an in-depth understanding of spontaneous viral clearance and provide needed information that will impact patient management and the design of candidate vaccines for HCV genotype 4. Specifically, we aim to use “-omics” or hypothesis-generating approaches to perform: (i) multi-analyte profiling of plasma analytes; (ii) characterization of HCV-specific cellular immune responses during the clearance phase; and (iii) assessment of genetic and epigenetic variations that predict viral clearance. Together, this will provide a framework for understanding the host response to acute HCV. In addition, we aim to establish a cooperative training program under the umbrella of the EU/MPC Research Collaboration – Fighting Hepatitis in Egypt, which will enhance Clinical Epidemiology and Biomarker Discovery. Cross-Consortia collaborations with the EU funded HepaCute Project and Egyptian funded STDF will further enhance the impact of our proposed work.",

            "STAMINA develops an intelligent decision support toolset for pandemic prediction and management and demonstrates its use by practitioners at national and regional levels within and across EU borders. The STAMINA toolset enables national planners and first responders to anticipate and respond to the the “known-unknowns” in their daily effort to enhance health security. Main functionality of the toolset includes: \n•\tReal-time web and social media analytics aiming at public trust monitoring and flagging possible disease outbreaks \n•\tPOCT and smart wearable diagnostic devices for first line screening \n•\tPredictive modeling of pandemic outbreak and its impact, along with decision-making support in implementing mitigation strategies, \n•\tEarly Warning System\n•\tCrisis management tool defining the roles and actions of key actors during crisis management\n•\tScenario Generation tool for creation of training scenarios\n•\tCommon Operational Picture as the main interface of the solution enabling timely and coordinated response\nThe toolset is accompanied by a set of Guidelines on effective implementation of risk communication principles and best practices in cross-organisational preparedness and response plans.\nThe use of the STAMINA toolset will be demonstrated through 12 national and regional small-scale demonstrators and one large-scale cross-border simulation exercise involving all consortium partners.",

            "With a global incidence increasing at 2% and two million deaths each year, tuberculosis (TB) demands the highest priority among communicable diseases linked to poverty. In developing countries, the vast majority of the TB cases affect the young adult population, increasing its economic impact. The TB-VAC project aims to develop improved vaccines, particularly for the young adult population. Vaccine candidates and strategies will be optimized for evaluation in Phase I clinical trials. TB-VAC consists of two tracks. Track 1. Optimisation of existing vaccine candidates towards Phase I trials.This track is composed of a strategic research component (WP1, 4 and 5) and a down stream development component (WP6). The strategic research focuses on goal-oriented research to optimize delivery and composition of during FP5 selected, promising candidate vaccines (eg, 72F, Hyb-1,85A) and on identification of correlates of protection and markers of TB disease for monitoring of future clinical trials. The downstream development component will carry out GMP production of optimised vaccine candidates, establish pre-clinical files and carry out Phase I clinical trials in European and TB-endemic countries. According to the results, the Consortium will decide upon a strategy to exploit this portfolio. Track 2. Discovery of new vaccine/antigens (WP2 and 3). This track will carry out innovative back-up research to identify and develop novel vaccines/antigens. In WP3, we will focus on subunit vaccines based on dormancy related antigens. In WP2, we proposes to optimise three selected live vaccine candidates that during FP5 showed improved efficacy as compared to BCG and show promise as vaccines in infants. Thirty institutions will participate at the start of this effort including two vaccine producers. Subcontracting will likely involve SMEs. Joint parnerships and funding of GMP production with MUVAPRED will exist.\n\n",

            "The aim of the research is the standardization of the analytical methodology of biogenic amines in fishery products. \nResearch was carried out in order to standardize the analytical methodology of biogenic amines in fishery products. This involved the comparison and standardization of analytical methods between reference laboratories and intercomparison exercises within the Community for the determination of biogenic amines in fish products and a description of standard operating procedures. \n\nFor histamine, the most important biogenic amine, putrescine, cadaverine and tyramine comparable results were obtained by the different methods used by the reference laboratories. About 90% of the biogenic amines were recovered from tuna and mackerel after sterilization. \n\nThe biogenic amines are stable in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) extracts of fish during storage at a temperature range -20 C +20 C. \n\nAbout 30% of the 35 European laboratories were able to determine histamine in fishery products (herring and tuna) at a (spiked) level of 25 to 110 mg/kg with an acceptable accuracy, repeatability and reproducibility using different analytical methods. \n\nThe accuracy and reproducibility of the methods, almost exclusively high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), among the laboratories used for the other biogenic amines like putrescine, cadaverine and spermidine in fishery products are in general less satisfactory than those for histamine. The number of laboratories with an acceptable accuracy and an acceptable repeatability within the laboratory was rather small. \n\nStandard operating procedures for the determination of biogenic amines in fishery products by CFA, HPLC (isocratic, gradient, precolumn and postcolumn derivatization) and IEC of the 4 reference laboratories were used.\nThe research project can be divided into 2 phases: \ncomparison and standardizing analytical methods between reference laboratories; \nand intercomparison exercises within the Community for the determination of biogenic amines in fish products and  description of standard operating procedures. \n\nIn the first phase, the 3 reference laboratories will compare and standardize their analytical methods for the determination of biogenic amines. Different high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods and continuous flow methods for the determination of histamine and the other biogenic amines will be tested on standard solutions, appropriate extracts of different fish samples and on different fish samples with intrinsic and extrinsic labelled biogenic amines. At the same time, an inquiry will be organized into the methods for the determination of biogenic amines used in the fish processing industry, the fish and food inspection services, and the fish and food industry in order to evaluate the specifications needed for the standardized methods like accuracy, reproducibility, detection limit, rate of analysis etc. \n\nThe second phase will involve intercomparison exercises within the Community for the determination of biogenic amines in fish products and description of standard operating procedures. In several intercomparison exercises, samples from different fish species with different levels of biogenic amines will be analysed by the various laboratories of the fish processing industry, the fish and food inspection services and the fish and food research institutes within the countries in the Community as well as by the reference laboratories.

            "The successful development of preventative strategies against HIV-1 (microbicides, vaccines or their combined effects) would provide a pivotal turning point in global efforts to combat the pandemic spread of AIDS providing an incalculable impact on solving societal problems associated with this disease. \nThe principal aim of this proposal is to bring together EU scientists from both microbicide and vaccine fields to embrace a coordinated approach to HIV-1 prevention research. Partners in the EUROPRISE consortium represent 14 projects funded by the European Commission in the sixth Framework as well as one project funded by the Gates Foundation. These projects involve 132 institutions from 22 countries. In this respect, EUROPRISE is the first organisation, both in Europe and internationally to deliberately bring these groups together in a truly integrated fashion. EUROPRISE will promote an integrated program of research, coordinating a wide portfolio of activities encompassing the whole pipeline of vaccine and microbicide development from early discovery through to early clinical trials. This unique approach places the Network at the international forefront of understanding the interface between these two technologies, pursing a critical path to the development of effective HIV-1 prevention strategies.\n\n",

Computer analysis of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional protein patterns to establish databases of pathogenic bacteria, biotechnologically important bacteria and eucaryotic cells provides methods for screening and identifying bacterial strains, recognizing new groups, and characterizing human and animal disease related protein abnormalities. For wide use, standardization of techniques is of paramount importance.\n\nA standard procedure has been developed for the production of 1-dimensional gels. A set of bacteria independently studied in 2 laboratories gave the same analytical result and the portability of the systems was demonstrated despite implementation on different computers using similar software. Databases were established for identification of bacterial species and protein types within species and standard 2-dimensional methodology was applied to human, murine, bacterial and streptomycete cells. A system using immobilized pH gradients for isoelectric focusing (IEF) was also developed providing greater reproducibility of 2-dimensional patterns. Computer systems of 2-dimensional gel analysis namely PDQUEST and BioImage were implemented and databases were established for the studied cell types. Standardized gels, analytical system and databases will allow major improvements in the study of developmental and disease processes in humans, and reliable, rapid identification of pathogenic and biotechnologically important bacteria.\nTHE LONG TERM OBJECTIVE IS TO ESTABLISH A DATABANK OF 2-D PATTERNS FOR THE STUDY OF HUMAN GENETIC DISORDERS. TO IMPLEMENT AND TEST EXISTING SOFTWARE AND TO COMPARE ITS PERFORMANCE WITH THE PDQUEST SYSTEM OF OTHER SYSTEMS AT INSTITUT PASTEUR. TO DEVELOP A PORTABLE SOFTWARE PACKAGE WITH ENHANCED PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO EXISTING SYSTEMS AND THE CAPABILITY OF USING ADVANCES IN ARRAY PROCESSOR TECHNOLOGY. THIS PACKAGE WILL BE INITIALLY TESTED AT INSTITUT PASTEUR AND THEN MADE AVAILABLE TO OTHER INSTITUTES. 2-D TECHNOLOGY AND ANALYTICAL FACILITIES WILL BE MADE FREELY AVAILABLE TO THE OTHER PARTICIPATING INSTITUTES.

IMPROVED INTERACTIVE COMPUTER GRAPHICS AND COMPUTER NETWORK COMMUNICATION. \n\nLONG TERM ECONOMIC BENEFITS IN HEALTH CARE AND INDUSTRIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY ARE TO BE EXPECTED. \nResearch was carried out to determine, by X-ray crystallography, the 3-dimensional structures of:\nantigen antibody complexes for which hen eggwhite lysozyme (HEL) was used as the model antigen;\nheterologous antigens (other avian lysozymes);\nFabNQ10 (from a monoclonal antiphenyloxazolone antibody) and its complexes with specific haptens;\nan idiotope antiidiotope complex.\n\nResults obtained in the study of the 3-dimensional structures were:\nthe determination of those of FabNQ10 free and bound to the phenyloxazolone hapten;\nthe refinement of the atomic coordinates of the antigen antibody complex FabD1.3-HEL;\nthe determination and refinement of the structures of the heterologous antigens, turkey and Japanese quail lysozymes;\nthe determination of the structure of an idiotope antiidiotope complex.\n\nAnother major result obtained was that of reshaping human antibodies: the antilysozyme activity of the mouse monoclonal antibody D1.3 was grafted by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) techniques onto a human immunoglobulin, a technique which should facilitate the production of therapeutic human (chimaeric) antibodies. The variable domains of the heavy chains (VH) and light chains (VL) of D1.3 were cloned and expressed in Esherichia coli. It was found that the VH domain binds lysozyme with an affinity constant (Kd = 19 nM) which is only 1 order of magnitude lower than that of the parent antibody (Kd = 2 nM).\nTHIS IS A JOINT PROJECT TO STUDY THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY INTERACTIONS. \n\nTHE AIMS OF THE PART OF THE PROJECT TO BE CARRIED OUT AT LEEDS UNIVERSITY ARE :  \n\n1) DETERMINATION OF THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE AT HIGH RESOLUTION OF THE ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY COMPLEX OF FAB D1.3 WITH HEN EGG WHITE LYSOZYME (IN COLLABORATION WITH INSTITUT PASTEUR). \n\n2) DETAILED ANALYSIS OF THE INTERMOLECULAR INTERACTIONS IN THE COMPLEX USING COMPUTER GRAPHICS AND POTENTIAL ENERGY CALCULATIONS TO ELUCIDATE THE BASIS OF ANTIBODY SPECIFICITY. PREDICTION OF THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF DIFFERENT AMINO-ACID RESIDUES TO THE AFFINITY. \n\n3) DEVELOPMENT OF INTERACTIVE COMPUTER GRAPHICS TECHNIQUES FOR THE REALIZATION OF 1) AND 2), THE PREDICTION OF STRUCTURE AND AFFINITY CHANGES THAT MIGHT BE PRODUCED BY SITE-DIRECTED MUTAGENESIS OF THE ANTIBODY OR ANTIGEN, AND THE MODELLING OF CONFORMATIONALLY RESTRICTED SYNTHETIC MOLECULES THAT COULD MIMIC THE ANTIGEN AND BIND TO THE ANTIBODY. \n\n4) DETERMINATION OF THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURES OF COMPLEXES INVOLVING MUTATED ANTIGEN OR ANTIBODY (IN COLLABORATION WITH INSTITUT PASTEUR AND MRC)., AND COMPARISON OF THE RESULTS WITH PREDICTIONS FROM COMPUTER GRAPHICS, MOLECULAR DYNAMICS AND CONFORMATIONAL ENERGY REFINEMENT CALCULATIONS. \n\n5) DEVELOPMENT OF THE USE OF COMPUTER NETWORK COMMUNICATION TO ALLOW TRANSFER OF DATA AND COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO THE OTHER THREE LABORATORIES.

            "West Nile Fever (WNF), Rift Valley Fever (RVF) and Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) are arthropod-borne diseases of different domestic and wild animals and can also affect humans, posing a great threat to public health because of their epidemic and zoonotic potential. Their geographical distribution has expanded in recent decades. WNF outbreaks have already occurred in Europe, CCHF is endemic in many countries including Europe. In 2000, RVF, was reported the first time outside of the African continent, cases being confirmed in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. This virgin-soil epidemic raises the threat of expansion into other parts of Asia and Europe. There is a general public concern regarding emerging zoonotic diseases which has gained new relevance in the light of global warming. This is especially true regarding the spread of vector-borne diseases such as CCHF, RVF and WNF. It is imperative to work out integrated control measures which include vector control, vaccination programmes, improved therapy strategies, diagnostic tools and surveillance, public awareness, capacity building and improvement of infrastructure in endemic regions. The anticipated project will address these areas specifically aiming at: 1) creating common knowledge on the diseases, sharing and exchanging data, expertise, experiences and scientific information; 2) maintaining and expanding surveillance systems, monitoring disease occurrence, and vaccine use; 3) introducing, distributing and harmonizing disease detection and control tools; 4) disseminating knowledge and training staff of relevant third countries; 5) interlinking different scientific disciplines which look at the problem from differrent angles. A coordinated research programme including key laboratories in Europe and neighbouring countries can address scientific questions of joint interest enabling the development of effective control measures, aimed at improving the EU's response to outbreaks of diseases.",

            "IMPROVED UNDERSTANDING OF THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY INTERACTIONS LEADING TO BASIC INFORMATION ON SIGNAL GENERATION BY ANTIBODY BINDING AND SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION. \n\nLONG TERM ECONOMIC BENEFITS IN HEALTH CARE AND INDUSTRIAL BIOTECHNOLOGY ARE TO BE EXPECTED. \nResearch was carried out to determine, by X-ray crystallography, the 3-dimensional structures of:\nantigen antibody complexes for which hen eggwhite lysozyme (HEL) was used as the model antigen;\nheterologous antigens (other avian lysozymes);\nFabNQ10 (from a monoclonal antiphenyloxazolone antibody) and its complexes with specific haptens;\nan idiotope antiidiotope complex.\n\nResults obtained in the study of the 3-dimensional structures were:\nthe determination of those of FabNQ10 free and bound to the phenyloxazolone hapten;\nthe refinement of the atomic coordinates of the antigen antibody complex FabD1.3-HEL;\nthe determination and refinement of the structures of the heterologous antigens, turkey and Japanese quail lysozymes;\nthe determination of the structure of an idiotope antiidiotope complex.\n\nAnother major result obtained was that of reshaping human antibodies: the antilysozyme activity of the mouse monoclonal antibody D1.3 was grafted by recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) techniques onto a human immunoglobulin, a technique which should facilitate the production of therapeutic human (chimaeric) antibodies. The variable domains of the heavy chains (VH) and light chains (VL) of D1.3 were cloned and expressed in Esherichia coli. It was found that the VH domain binds lysozyme with an affinity constant (Kd = 19 nM) which is only 1 order of magnitude lower than that of the parent antibody (Kd = 2 nM).\nTHIS IS A JOINT PROJECT TO STUDY THE MOLECULAR BASIS OF ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY INTERACTIONS. \n\nTHE SPECIFIC AIMS OF THE RESEARCH WORK TO BE CARRIED OUT AT PASTEUR, ARE : \n\n 1) THE DETERMINATION OF THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF A FAB-LYSOZYME ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY COMPLEX, INCLUDING THE CRYSTALLOGRAPHIC REFINEMENT OF THE STRUCTURE; \n 2) CRYSTALLIZATION TRIALS OF ADDITIONAL FAB-LYSOZYME COMPLEXES FROM MURINE MONOCLONAL ANTI-LYSOZYME ANTIBODIES AND OTHER ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY COMPLEXES; \n 3) DETERMINATION OF THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF MUTATED-ANTIGENS ANTIBODY COMPLEXES; \n 4) DETERMINATION OF THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF FAB NQ10/12.5 DERIVED FROM A MURINE MONOCLONAL ANTI-PHENYL OXAZOLONE ANTIBODY.; \n 5) THE DETERMINATION OF THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF THE COMPLEX ANTI-LYSOZYME FAB D1.3/ANTI-IDIOTYPIC FAB 225 WHICHRECOGNIZES THE IDIOTYPE OF D1.3; \n 6) DETERMINATION OF THE THREE-DIMENSIONAL STRUCTURE OF A COMPLEX BETWEEN A HETEROCLITIC ANTI-LYSOZYME FAB AND A HETEROLOGOUS ANTIGEN, PHEASANT LYSOZYME AND OF THE ANTIGEN-ANTIBODY INTERACTIONS OF THE COMPLEX.

            '"ZIKAlliance is a multidisciplinary project with a global ""One Health"" approach, built: on a multi-centric network of clinical cohorts in the Caribbean, Central & South America; research sites in countries where the virus has been or is currently circulating (Africa, Asia, Polynesia) or at risk for emergence (Reunion Island); a strong network of European and Brazilian clinical & basic research institutions; and multiple interfaces with other scientific and public health programmes. ZIKAlliance will addrees three key objectives relating to (i) impact of Zika virus (ZIKV) infection during pregnancy and short & medium term effects on newborns, (ii) associated natural history of ZIKV infection in humans and their environment in the context of other circulating arboviruses and (iii) building the overall capacity for preparedness research for future epidemic threats in Latin America & the Caribbean. The project will take advantage of large standardised clinical cohorts of pregnant women and febrile patients in regions of Latin America and the Caribbean were the virus is circulating, expanding a preexisting network established by the IDAMS EU project. I will also benefit of a very strong expertise in basic and environmental sciences, with access to both field work and sophisticated technological infrastructures to characterise virus replication and physiopathology mechanisms. To meet its 3 key objectives, the scientific project has been organised in 9 work packages, with WP2/3 dedicated to clinical research (cohorts, clinical biology, epidemiology & modeling), WP3/4 to basic research (virology & antivirals, pathophysiology & animal models), WP5/6 to environmental research (animal reservoirs, vectors & vector control) , WP7/8 to social sciences & communication, and WP9 to management. The broad consortium set-up allow gathering the necessary expertise for an actual interdisciplinary approach, and operating in a range of countries with contrasting ZIKV epidemiological status."',

            "To address the call for proposals 'Biology and control of vector-borne infections in Europe' launched by the European Commission, we want to investigate the biological, ecological and epidemiological components of vector-borne diseases (VBD) introduction, emergence and spread, and to propose innovative tools for controlling them, building on the basis of acquired knowledge. We have selected the main groups of arthropod vectors involved in the transmission of vector-borne diseases in Europe: ticks, mosquitoes, sandflies, and biting midges (Culicoides). We have also selected the main diseases of actual or possible importance in human and veterinary public health. Rodents, insectivores and rodent-borne diseases have also been considered, both for their direct importance in public health, and for the major role of rodents and insectivores as reservoir hosts of many pathogens. We have put a strong focus on vector- and disease-quantitative modelling. The resulting predictive models will be used to assess climate or environmental change scenarios, as well as vector or disease control strategies.\nHuman behaviour and risk perception are an important component of VBD introduction, emergence and spread. The consequences triggered by VBD for human and veterinary public health in Europe are just starting to emerge in public awareness. We will also account for this aspect of human and veterinary public health in our proposal.\nFinally, the set of innovative research methods, tools and results obtained during the project will be a step forward a generic approach of VBD in terms of disease monitoring and early warning systems, and will reinforce the general framework for an integrated pest and disease management system.\nFor all these aspects, we will benefit from, and amplify the strong scientific results, capacity building, and research networks established by EDEN project on emerging, vector-borne diseases in a changing European environment.",

            "ReCoDID builds on existing infrastructures and partnerships to develop a sustainable model for the storage, curation, and analyses of the complex data sets collected by infectious disease (ID)-related cohorts. While ID cohorts collect both clinical-epidemiological (CE) and terabytes of OMICS data, storage and analysis of CE and high dimensional laboratory (HDL) data remains separate and developing the infrastructure for housing and analysing HDL data is not feasible for individual studies.  In this project, we develop innovative approaches to the synthesis and analysis of CE&HDL data, and modify governance models for cloud-based repositories elaborated by and for scientists in high-income countries to meet the specific challenges of synthesizing CE&HDL data and sharing data across international cohorts and with the Open Science community. We develop data architecture and governance that link biobanks to data repositories to facilitate equitable use, collaborative, cross-domain analyses, and replicability.  The team leverages partnerships with multicentre ID cohorts in the global South, and connects EU investments in OMICS infrastructures with Canadian expertise on pipeline and workflow development, biostatistical methods, and ethical and governance issues related to the establishment of repositories for CE&HDL data in resource-limited settings. Drawing from best practice and governance elaborated for similar initiatives, the repository will employ a federated model where a tiered permission system and cohort-specific hubs facilitate cohorts’ analysis of their own data, cross-cohort analyses, and connections with the open science community within a clearly elaborated legal, ethical, and equitable framework. The cloud-based platform will provide analytic tools and computational power to facilitate cross-domain, collaborative analyses that inform personalized medicine approaches to diagnostic, treatment, and vaccine development in ID-focused international cohorts.",

            "The overall objective of the Infravec2 project is to integrate key specialized research facilities necessary for European excellence in insect vector biology, to open the infrastructure for European access, and to develop new vector control measures targeting the greatest threats to human health and animal industries. Infravec2 is an Advanced Community, following a four-year Starting Community lifecycle (FP7 Infravec1). Lack of access to key infrastructures limits European vector research and impedes development of vector control measures. Insect vectors transmit parasitic diseases such as malaria and leishmaniasis, and viral infections such as chikungunya, dengue, Zika, Japanese encephalitis and yellow fever. Vector-borne diseases, which have historically been a problem of tropical countries, now represent a threat for temperate regions of the world including much of Europe. The 24 consortium partners, including 4 commercial companies, hold the major European biosecure insectaries for experimental infection and containment of insect vectors under Containment Level 2 and 3 (CL2/CL3) conditions, other key insect vector facilities, and include front-line field sites in Africa, the Pacific, and the Americas. Infravec2 will implement comparable standards across the secure insectary facilities as a world first, improving exploitation of European vector infrastructures for research and public health, and will develop other innovative methodologies and technologies. Networking activities will assure that the project achieves full impact, producing a step change in European vector biology research and the product pipeline, and consolidating European global leadership in insect vectors. The goal of the Infravec2 project is to build a durable European infrastructure to control insect vector-borne disease, including with power to predict and prevent the inevitable next epidemic outbreak in advance.",

            "EVA-GLOBAL gathers 38 academic institutions at the forefront of human, animal and plant research in Virology, associated with key Non-Governmental Organisations including the World Health Organisation, OIE, FAO and related international organizations such as the CGIAR. This new project is built on the strong foundations constituted two previous EVA (2009-2014), FP7 and EVAg (2014-2019), H2020 projects. It includes high calibre institutes with the appropriate expertise to collect, characterise, standardise, authenticate and distribute human, animal and plant viruses. EVA-GLOBAL is conceived to be an open access entity aiming at developing synergies and complementary capabilities in such a way to offer an improved access to the researchers. A single-entry point, the web-based catalogue, gives a facilitate access to the end-user, to the collections including viruses, derived materials and engineered cells. This project will integrate 13 facilities dedicated to the high-risk pathogens manipulations (BSL4), which constitutes the largest BSL4 network worldwide. EVA-GLOBAL will also link up with other network-based virus associated programmes that exist globally. This unique advanced community aims at becoming the most responsive network to improve the control of emerging or re-emerging virus outbreaks at the global level. During the past EVAg project, this infrastructure has already been able to play a key role for the control of emerging virus diseases by the supply of unique reagents for the detection of viruses under the WHO umbrella. Through this new ambitious four-year project and the new institutes joining the consortium, EVA-GLOBAL will become the largest virtual virus collection for human, animal and plant viruses will move beyond the current state-of-the-art to provide an increasingly valuable resource and service to the scientific community, including government health departments, higher education institutes, industry and to the general public as well.",

            "The ZikaPLAN initiative combines the strengths of 25 partners in Latin America, North America, Africa, Asia, and various centres in Europe to address the urgent research gaps (WP 1-8) in Zika, identifying short-and long term solutions (WP 9-10) and building a sustainable Latin-American EID Preparedness and Response capacity (WP 11-12). \nWe will conduct clinical studies to further refine the full spectrum and risk factors of congenital Zika syndrome (including neurodevelopmental milestones in the first 3 years of life), and delineate neurological complications associated with Zika due to direct neuroinvasion and immune-mediated responses. Laboratory based research to unravel neurotropism, investigate the role of sexual transmission, determinants of severe disease, and viral fitness will envelop the clinical studies.\nBurden of disease and modelling studies will assemble a wealth of data including a longitudinal cohort study of 17,000 subjects aged 2-59 in 14 different geographic locations in Brazil over 3 years. Data driven vector control and vaccine modelling as well as risk assessments on geographic spread of Zika will form the foundation for evidence-informed policies.\nThe Platform for Diagnostics Innovation and Evaluation will develop novel ZIKV diagnostic tests in accordance with WHO Target Product Profiles. Our global network of laboratory and clinical sites with well-characterized specimens is set out to accelerate the evaluation of the performance of such tests. \nBased on qualitative research, we will develop supportive, actionable messages to affected communities, and develop novel personal protective measures. Our final objective is for the Zika outbreak response effort to grow into a sustainable Latin-American network for emerging infectious diseases research preparedness. To this end we will engage in capacity building in laboratory and clinical research, collaborate with existing networks to share knowledge and tackle regulatory and other bottlenecks.",

            "IMPROVED AND MORE EFFICIENT TOOLS FOR THE SCREENING OF MICROBIAL STRAINS FOR BIOTECHNOLOGICAL PROCESSES, DETECTION OF CONTAMINANTS, IDENTIFICATION OF STRAINS, ESPECIALLY PATENTED BIOTECHNOLOGICAL AND PATHOGENIC STRAINS. \n\nSTUDY OF GENE EXPRESSION IN EUKARYOTE CELLS, UNDERSTANDING AND IMPROVED DIAGNOSIS OF DISEASE-RELATED PROTEIN ABNORMALITIES. \nThe technique for one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) of proteins was standardised to enhance reproducibility, necessary for computer comparison, database construction and portability. The process was completely tested and the reproducibility obtained was sufficient to allow the possibility of large and long term database construction.\n\nA Siemens 7570-C implemented FORTRAN 77 and UCSD-like PASCAL program has been developed for the storage, retrieval and modification of one-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) protein profiles. The database program was extended with procedures for both fast identification and numerical comparison of a limited set of 1-dimensional SDS-PAGE protein profiles (up to 800).\n\nA microcomputer implemented PASCAL program was developed for the automated alignment of 1-dimensional sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) protein profiles. The electrophoretic pattern of bacterial strain Psychrobacter immobilis LMG 1125 is used as a universal reference profile.\n\n1-dimensional and 2-dimensional electrophoretic techniques provide powerful tools for the analysis of complex protein mixtures. Computer analysis of 1-dimensional and 2-dimensional protein patterns to establish databases of pathogenic bacteria, biotechnologically important bacteria and eucaryotic cells provides methods for screening and identifying bacterial strains, recognizing new groups, and characterizing human and animal disease related protein abnormalities. For wide use, standardization of techniques is of paramount importance.\n\nA standard procedure has been developed for the production of 1-dimensional gels. A set of bacteria independently studied in 2 laboratories gave the same analytical result and the portability of the systems was demonstrated despite implementation on different computers using similar software. Databases were established for identification of bacterial species and protein types within species and standard 2-dimensional methodology was applied to human, murine, bacterial and streptomycete cells. A system using immobilized pH gradients for isoelectric focusing (IEF) was also developed providing greater reproducibility of 2-dimensional patterns. Computer systems of 2-dimensional gel analysis namely PDQUEST and BioImage were implemented and databases were established for the studied cell types. Standardized gels, analytical system and databases will allow major improvements in the study of developmental and disease processes in humans, and reliable, rapid identification of pathogenic and biotechnologically important bacteria.\nDEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE AND DATABANK FOR 1-D PATTERNS OF BIOTECHNOLOGICALLY IMPORTANT BACTERIA, USING STRAINS HELD IN THE LABORATORY OF MICROBIOLOGY, GENT CULTURE COLLECTION (LMG), ON WHICH EXTENSIVE GENOMIC AND BIOTECHNOLOGICAL DATA EXISTS. THERE WILL BE CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH THE NATIONAL COLLECTION OF TYPE CULTURES (NCTC).COLINDALE, UK ON PREPARATION AND RUNNING OF GELS, EXCHANGE OF SOFTWARE FOR HARDWARE COMMON TO BOTH (LKB DENSITOMETERS/APPLE MICROCOMPUTERS), EXCHANGE OF STRAINS, EXTRACTS AND GELS. 2-D PAGE ON SELECTED STRAINS WILL BE ANALYSED IN COLLABORATION WITH THE ROYAL POSTGRADUATE SCHOOL, LONDON AND INSTITUTE PASTEUR, PARIS.

            "The overall objective of the viRgil Network of Excellence is to set up the first-ever European Vigilance Network capable of addressing current and emerging antiviral drugs resistance developments. Focusing first on three major diseases (influenza and viral hepatitis B and C), our strategy is to build a sustainable, patient-oriented 'virtual institute' by integrating the currently fragmented European capacities into interacting platforms that together will allow the containment of the problem of viral drug resistance. Being approach- rather than virus- based, the integration process will be flexible enough to embrace in the future drug resistance problems related to other human viruses. Indeed, the proposed complementary platforms will focus each on a topic contributing towards broad objectives: the setting-up of the viRgil clinical platforms (surveillance and virology) will allow a global approach for monitoring, testing and ultimately improving the management of antiviral drug resistance in treated patients, leading to outstanding practices and standards in Europe. Attention will be paid to specific patient communities (children, women). These activities will be strengthened by knowledge generated from the in vitro and in vivo models platform, which will elucidate the mechanisms of the the development of resistance, and from the host determinants platform aiming at understanding patient-related (immune/genetic) factors conditioning viral drug resistance. Platforms dedicated to drugs and pharmacological aspects as well as innovation and technology will enable to anticipate viral resistance against promising drugs closed to clinical application and to overcome future resistance problems by proposing more rational approaches for drug development to the private sector and effective tools for testing resistance to the clinicians. Lastly, viRgil objectives and the benefit for the community will be constantly evaluated by the societal impact platforrm.\n\n",
